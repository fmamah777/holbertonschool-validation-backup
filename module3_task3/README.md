<h1>Module 3: Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment</h1>
<h2>Faizal Mamah</h2>

# HolbertonSchool-Validation

## Prerequisites

- GoHugo v0.80+
- goLang

## Workflow

You are expected to create a new [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) named `module3_task0` with only the following steps:

- Clone the repository,
- Position yourself in the correct directory and execute the command `make help` to validate that the Makefile is present and implements the help target.

This workflow must be [triggered](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows):

- Each time there is new code pushed on your repository,
- And once per day (whatever time you want).
